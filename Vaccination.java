/*1.Create abstract class vaccine.Create two variables age(int),nationality(String).
create 2 concrete methods firstDose() and secondDose(). Scenario 1:user can take the 
first dose if the user is Indian and age is 18. After vaccination the user has to 
pay 250rs(which will be displayed on the console). 
Scenario 2: Users are eligible to take the second dose only after completing the first dose. 
Scenario 3: create abstract method boosterDose() in abstract class Vaccine.
Create one implementation class vaccinationSuccessful, where implement boosterDose() method.
Create main class vaccination and invoke all methods accordingly.
[Hint:Create constructor to initialize variables age and nationality,
 Use flow control(Ifelse) to checkÂ condition]
